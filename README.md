This is a project from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data
Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
The code defined a schema for this database and imported the datasets into pgAdmin according to the schema. Then queries were conducted to help Home Credit better understand its clients and its operations.
